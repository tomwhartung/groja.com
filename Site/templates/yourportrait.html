      <h3>Handmade Portraits</h3>
      <p>
       Although a large part of this process is automated by the
        Groja Program &copy;, producing high-quality, unique and
        personalized portraits takes time.
       Add to that the possibility that I will want to
        ensure customers understand and appreciate its significance
        means that each image requires a personal touch.</p>
      <p>
       Also, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
        orientations (portrait vs. landscape) and even different compositions.
       At this time, these options not currently demonstrated in the
        <a href="http://seeourminds.com/galleries/gallery.html"

         galleries</a>.
       If you are willing to work with me a bit, I can help you determine
        what sort of image you like the most and
        ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!</p>
      <h3>Your <span class="emphasized">Personalized</span> Portrait</h3>

       If you know your four-letter type, check out the corresponding

       Although it is not unique &mdash; and does not reflect the degree
        of your your personal preferences &mdash; you
        <em>can</em> consider it to be an image of your personality.
       So feel free to download and enjoy it!

       If the generic portrait of your four-letter type is not personalized enough for you, please

       However, I have put a lot of time &mdash; years, in fact &mdash; into coming up with this idea,
        writing the
        <a href="../about/#versions" title="Link to the list of versions on the 'About' page">
          various versions</a>
        of the program, building and managing this site and its predecessors and
        ultimately the (highly unnatural &mdash; for me, anyway) effort required to
        let people know that this service is available.</p>
      <p>
       And of course after all that, there is the time spent creating a personalized image and
        making sure it meets your satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I hope that if you are interested, you will

        highly personal Spiritual Portrait &mdash; one that you can fully
