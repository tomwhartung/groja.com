       <h3>Handmade Portraits</h3>
       <p>
        Although a large part of this process is automated by the
         Groja Program &copy;, producing high-quality, unique and
         personalized portraits takes time.
        Add to that the possibility that I will want to
         ensure customers understand and appreciate its significance
         means that each image requires a personal touch.</p>
       <p>
        Also, the program contains many options, such as different resolutions and
         orientations (portrait vs. landscape) and even different compositions.
        At this time, these options not currently demonstrated in the
         <a href="http://seeourminds.com/galleries/gallery.html"
            title="Link to the galleries page on seeourminds.com" target="_blank">
          galleries</a>.
        If you are willing to work with me a bit, I can help you determine
         what sort of image you like the most and
         ensure it is within your price range before starting on it!</p>
       <h3>Your <span class="emphasized">Personalized</span> Portrait</h3>
       <p>
        If you know your four-letter type, check out the corresponding
         image (called a <span class="air-quotes">generic portrait</span>)
         in the

        Although it is not unique &mdash; and does not reflect the degree
         of your your personal preferences &mdash; you
         <em>can</em> consider it to be an image of your personality.
        So feel free to download and enjoy it!
       </p>
       <p>
        If the generic portrait of your four-letter type is not personalized enough for you, please
         <a href="conversion/groja" title="Link to contact us page">
          contact us</a>
         to discuss what you might want and how much it will cost.</p>

       <h3>How Much?</h3>
       <p>
        The cost of each Spiritual Portrait ranges from $0 to $1000,
         depending on how much work I have to put into making it.

        However, I have put a lot of time &mdash; years, in fact &mdash; into coming up with this idea,
         writing the
         <a href="../about/#versions" title="Link to the list of versions on the 'About' page">
           various versions</a>
         of the program, building and managing this site and its predecessors and
         ultimately the (highly unnatural &mdash; for me, anyway) effort required to
         let people know that this service is available.</p>
       <p>
        And of course after all that, there is the time spent creating a personalized image and
         making sure it meets your satisfaction.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I hope that if you are interested, you will

          contact us</a>
         and give us the opportunity to create a beautiful, unique, and
         highly personal Spiritual Portrait &mdash; one that you can fully
         appreciate and enjoy now and for years to come!
