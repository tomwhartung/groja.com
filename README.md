# README.md

Site to explain and sell my Spritual Portraits which are Graphical Representations of Jungian Archetypes or GROJAs.

# Initial Setup

For details on the steps I used to set up this site, see `README-creation.md` in this directory.

# Setting up a New Server

Documentation on how to set up a new server is in the `jmws_accountrements` repo, along with the docs for
setting up the other sites I run out of my home.

For details on the steps I used to get this site to run on the new server `barbara` under Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa,
see the following files in `jmws_accountrements`:
