# groja.com-mdb

Reorganize current content on groja.com and:

- shorten the top-level menu
- add the new legal pages
- convert from Bootstrap to Material Design Bootstrap (MDB)

## Plan

[x] 1. Create new repo, `groja.com-mdb` , and populate it with the existing code in the `groja.com` repo

[ ] 2. Replace existing home page with code from `/material_design/05-material_design_bootstrap/02-landing_page/Site` in the `always_learning_google_products` repo
- [ ] 2.1. Update `base.html` template
- [ ] 2.2. Replace static files as necessary
- [ ] 2.3. Use local files rather than CDN - my connection sucks
- [ ] 2.4. Don't care about what the other pages look like right now

[ ] 3. Replace Galleries option with drop-down menu for legal pages

[ ] 4. Consolidate existing menu options
- [ ] 4.1. Consolidate Books and Sites under About
- [ ] 4.1. Consolidate Books and Sites under About
